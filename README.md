# Supermarket Sales Analysis

## Project Overview
This project explores supermarket sales data to uncover insights into customer behavior, product performance, and sales trends. By employing data analysis techniques such as **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, **ANOVA**, and **Regression Modeling**, the study aims to enhance decision-making for inventory management, marketing strategies, and operational efficiency.

## Objectives
- Identify key factors influencing supermarket sales and customer preferences.
- Examine time-based sales trends for revenue optimization.
- Build a predictive model for future sales forecasting.

## Methodology

### Data Preprocessing
- Transaction-level data was cleaned and formatted.
- Categorical variables (e.g., product lines, payment methods) were one-hot encoded.
- Temporal features (e.g., day of the week, time of day) were extracted.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Sales distribution was analyzed across different **cities**, **product lines**, and **customer types**.
- Gender-based sales patterns were visualized to identify purchasing behaviors.
- Time-series analysis revealed peak sales periods and fluctuations.

### Statistical Analysis
- **ANOVA** was used to test differences in sales performance across product lines and customer demographics.
- Correlation analysis identified relationships between features such as **quantity sold, unit price, and revenue**.

### Predictive Modeling
- A **linear regression model** was developed to predict sales based on multiple features.
- **Feature importance** was evaluated to identify key drivers of revenue.
- Model performance was assessed using **R², Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Mean Squared Error (MSE).**

## Key Findings
- **Electronic Accessories and Food & Beverages** are the top-performing product categories.
- **Health & Beauty** showed lower sales and profitability, requiring strategic interventions.
- **Gender differences** in purchasing behavior suggest opportunities for targeted marketing.
- **Peak sales occur during evenings and weekends**, indicating the need for better staff planning.
- The **linear regression model achieved an R² of 90.4%**, demonstrating strong predictive performance.

## Recommendations
1. **Prioritize high-demand product lines** (Electronic Accessories, Food & Beverages) for inventory and promotions.
2. **Improve sales of Health & Beauty products** through targeted discounts and marketing.
3. **Optimize staffing** during peak sales hours (evenings and weekends).
4. **Enhance customer segmentation** strategies by tailoring promotions to gender-based preferences.
5. **Implement advanced machine learning models** to refine sales forecasting.

## Conclusion
This project highlights the power of data-driven insights in the retail sector. By leveraging statistical analysis and machine learning techniques, supermarkets can enhance sales performance, improve inventory management, and optimize customer engagement strategies.
